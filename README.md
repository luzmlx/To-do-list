## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "rec5IsjtYoiCvfkzN",
            "fields": {
                "To-Do": "Cook",
                "completed": true,
                "comments": "Lasagna vs. Homemade Pizza",
                "date": "2021-06-13"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-13T03:50:19.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recmuq1rnhhpPM9Z9",
            "fields": {
                "To-Do": "Homework",
                "completed": true,
                "date": "2021-07-14",
                "comments": "Algebra hw"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-13T03:50:19.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recORjd1HeZFJnyiH",
            "fields": {
                "To-Do": "Clean",
                "date": "2021-07-13",
                "comments": "sweep and mop floor"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-13T03:50:19.000Z"
        }
    ],
    "offset": "recORjd1HeZFJnyiH"
}

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I believe my strengths will be in completing the forms and creating a responsive design. 

### Weaknesses:
I'm not the best with React JS code so I will definitely have to revisit past lessons to get a more clear understanding of what to do. 

### Opportunities:
I'm excited to create an aesthetic website by implementing css styling. I also have the helpful resources available if I ever need help. 

### Threats:
Life is unknown and hopefully this next week nothing happens to put me behind on my work. I also have to remind myself constantly to take advantage of the resources available.
