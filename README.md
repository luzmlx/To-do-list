## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "rec5IsjtYoiCvfkzN",
            "fields": {
                "To-Do": "Cook",
                "completed": true,
                "comments": "Lasagna vs. Homemade Pizza",
                "date": "2021-06-13"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-13T03:50:19.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recmuq1rnhhpPM9Z9",
            "fields": {

            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-13T03:50:19.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recORjd1HeZFJnyiH",
            "fields": {

            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-13T03:50:19.000Z"
